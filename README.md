## Live Website (Deployed)
First, I built the app using "ng build --prod --base-href [url of website]".  After building, I downloaded the npm package
angular-cli-ghpages.  I moved the code generated from the ng build (dist folder) out of a subfolder called "my-app" into the root of the
dist folder; then, ran the command "ngh."

This was after updating my git version to latest and looking at numerous examples such as:

My app's website URL is: https://tucosc484.github.io/assignment-4-EVogel1999
